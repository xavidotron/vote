# Vote Xavid Pretzer for Town Meeting in Precinct 17

Arlington's town election is April 10th, 2021!

I'm Xavid Pretzer, and I'd be honored to represent Precinct 17 in Town Meeting.

Arlington faces important decisions this year. I hope to become a Town Meeting member to promote:
* Funding affordable housing
* Allowing accessory dwelling units to help address housing costs
* Supporting public transit
* Prioritizing renewable energy
* Improving accessibility
* Improving equity for minorities

I'd love to learn what's important to you and answer any questions! I invite you to email me at xavid@xavid.us

I'm also having a Q&A Zoom event at 8pm on March 28th. [
